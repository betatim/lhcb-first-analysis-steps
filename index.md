## Topics

1.  [Using screen to keep things running](01-screen.html)
2.  basic option file for DaVinci
3.  find the dataset in the Bookkeeping
4.  ganga jobs
5.  retrieve big files from the grid
6.  open the resulting nTuple in ROOT and make mass peak

This is a rough list of the areas we would like to cover:

* Setting up your development environment
* Working with the repository
* First DecayTreeTuple on the grid (including screen, EOS storage, ...)
* Fun with LoKi functors
* (re/ab)using a stripping line
* Swapping mass hypotheses
* Decay tree fitter
* TIS, TOS and HLT
* Applying multivariate tools in DecayTreeTuple

Each area needs to be broken down into chunks of 10-15minute topics.
